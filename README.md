# PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.9)

## Introduction
This is a collection of pipelines to be used for NGS (both DNA and RNA) analyses, from alignment to variant calling.

Start by creating a clone of the repository:

<pre><code>cd /path/to/some/directory
git clone git@github.com:pughlab/pipeline-suite.git
</code></pre>

Additionally, the report generation portion of this tool requires installation of the BPG plotting package for R:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BoutrosLab.plotting.general

## Workflow
See the [wiki](https://github.com/pughlab/pipeline-suite/wiki) for detailed instructions on how to set up a new project and run the pipeline.
