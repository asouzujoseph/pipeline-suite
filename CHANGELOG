2021-09-30: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.7)
- turned all tools off by default
- added extra layer of dependencies for pughlab_dnaseq_pipeline.pl --variant_calling to reduce failure due to job overload
- fixes to convert_novobreak and convert_pindel for compatibility with mavis
- updated paths for panel of normals for mutect and mutect2
- added checks to make panel of normals (mutect, mutect2, strelka, vardict, varscan)
- added checks to run final combine step (where necessary)
- split mutect2 to run per-chromosome (somatic and artefact-detection)
- simplified novobreak (removed split by chr-pairs); this requires more time/memory, but is much less error prone
- minor edits/bug fixes throughout
