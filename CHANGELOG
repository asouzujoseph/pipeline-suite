2021-10-29: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.6.0)
- initial add of panelCN.mops for targeted-seq data
- major update to genotype_gvcfs; added hard filtering and annotation options
- added more information to output log for mavis
- added simple filters (recurrence; short INDELs) to mavis output for cbioportal
- minor updates and bug fixes

2021-10-22: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.9)
- mavis output: cleaned up output and added new cbio sv format
- added optional vcf2maf step to genotype_gvcfs
- added option to customize recurrence threshold (number of samples) for PoN creation
- mavis: added step to extract key drawings and compress all intermediate files
- added read quality filter to pindel for high-confidence calls
- minor bug fixes to report scripts
- updated report to work with single sample data

2021-10-08: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.8)
- fixed bug in convert_svict that removed ALL rows
- removed unnecessary warnings in mavis for tumour-only samples
- fixed issue in novobreak for finding required files
- updates to summarize and report functions
- update: added 'group' option for job submissions

2021-09-30: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.7)
- turned all tools off by default
- added extra layer of dependencies for pughlab_dnaseq_pipeline.pl --variant_calling to reduce failure due to job overload
- fixes to convert_novobreak and convert_pindel for compatibility with mavis
- updated paths for panel of normals for mutect and mutect2
- added checks to make panel of normals (mutect, mutect2, strelka, vardict, varscan)
- added checks to run final combine step (where necessary)
- split mutect2 to run per-chromosome (somatic and artefact-detection)
- simplified novobreak (removed split by chr-pairs); this requires more time/memory, but is much less error prone
- minor edits/bug fixes throughout

2021-09-22: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.6)
- added single-end alignment option to bwa.pl

2021-09-20: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.5)
- minor updates to pindel pipeline to improve run filtering
- minor fix to novobreak (missing n_cpus args)
- minor fix to pughlab_dnaseq_pipeline.pl (typo)

2021-09-17: PughLab pipeline-suite (version 0.5.4)
